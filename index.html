    <p class="font1">We all like Ythaca this time of year, but the "AVENUE CLOSED AT DAWN" sign made Tammy very distressed at the though that "Waiting here until the morning might make me miss the whole meeting". She was upset with herself for choosing the WA route, instead of taking Route 48 through Greenwich, PA. She was suliking, pulled over in the parking lot under the brilliantly lit  "AYAHUASCA MOTEL" sign in the middle of the desert.</p>
